## Reflection

Honestly, after a not so careful evaluation of my source code, there are a lot of things wrong in there.
For one, there is hardly any error handling of any kind, also many of the arguments inside some functions are straight up
brute force level of coding without any algorithmic touch to them at all, if it works, it works I guess.

While I recognize a lot of things wrong here, I also think that it's really not that bad. Code cleanliness for example,
I think that my code is easy to understand at first glance, I also put in the effort to make the format of my code consistent throughout the source code.
